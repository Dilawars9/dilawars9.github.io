# Research Overview

My doctoral research focuses on uncovering the mechanistic details of template-assisted synthesis and the photochemical/thermal isomerization pathways of photoresponsive azo crown ethers. I employ advanced electronic structure methods to map ground and excited-state potential energy surfaces (PES), locating critical features such as conical intersections to characterize reaction pathways.

### 🧪 Mechanistic Investigations of Crown Ethers
I investigate the reaction pathways involved in the template synthesis of crown ethers. My work provides atomistic insights into:
* **Template Synthesis:** Uncovering the formation mechanisms of **Dibenzo-18-Crown-6** and **Benzo-21-Crown-7** from catechol precursors in the presence of bases.
* **Reaction Dynamics:** Modeling the molecular dynamics of reactive intermediates and transition states.

### ☀️ Photochemistry & Nonadiabatic Dynamics
A major part of my work involves studying light-matter interaction and excited-state processes in photoactive systems:
* **Azo-Crown Ethers:** Exploring the **trans $\to$ cis** and thermal **cis $\to$ trans** isomerization pathways of systems like **Azobis(Benzo-15-Crown-5)** and **Azobenzo-13-Crown Ether**.
* **Conical Intersections:** Locating topology features on the PES that facilitate non-radiative decay and isomerization.
* **Methodology:** Utilizing spin-flip extensions (SF-TDDFT and MRSF-TDDFT) to accurately describe multi-reference character in excited states.

### 💡 Photophysical Phenomena (Collaborative)
I collaborate on exploring photophysical properties in fluorescent molecular systems, focusing on:
* **Excited-State Proton Transfer (ESPT) & Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT)**.
* **Aggregation-Induced Emission (AIE)** and Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT/TICT).
* ]**Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC)** and Intersystem Crossing (ISC).

## 💻 Computational Development
To support theoretical studies, I develop custom tools for workflow automation:
* **Automation:** Custom **Python** and **Bash** scripts for structure interpolation and pre-/post-processing of quantum chemical data.
* **Simulation:** Running Molecular Dynamics simulations using **xTB** and **MLatom**.
