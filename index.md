#  Welcome

I am a **Computational Chemist** specializing in reaction mechanisms, photochemistry, and electronic structure theory. 

My work combines **Quantum Dynamics**, **DFT**, and **Nonadiabatic Dynamics** to understand how molecules behave in excited states.

##  Key Highlights

* **Mechanism Discovery:** Uncovering formation pathways of crown ethers using DFT.
* **Photochemistry:** Modeling *cis-trans* isomerization in Azo-crown ethers.
* **Tool Development:** creating Python/Bash workflows for Gaussian & ORCA automation.
