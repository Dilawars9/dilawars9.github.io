# Welcome to My Research Portfolio
My name is Dilawar, and I'm a 5th-year PhD student specializing in theoretical and computational chemistry.
Part of my thesis focused on modeling crown-ether synthesis reaction pathways to highlight the importance of the Template effect.
The other part focused on elucidating Azo-Crown-based molecules' Photo and Thermal isomerization pathways.


## Research Highlights
- **Density Functional Theory (DFT)**
- **Time-Dependent DFT (TDDFT)**
- **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**

Feel free to explore my [Research](research.md) and [Publications](publications.md).
